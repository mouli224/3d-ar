```

## Post-Deployment Testing

1. **Home Page** - Should load with animated UI
2. **Model Upload** - Should store files in localStorage  
3. **AR View** - Should access camera and display models
4. **Data Persistence** - Uploaded models should persist between sessions

## Architecture

```
Browser â†’ React Frontend â†’ localStorage API
                         â†“
                   Browser Storage
```

**No backend required!** ðŸŽ‰

## Vercel Settings

If deploying manually through Vercel dashboard:
- **Framework Preset**: Create React App
- **Root Directory**: `frontend`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Support

The app is now completely self-contained and should deploy without any issues to Vercel or any other static hosting platform.
